- watched [NYU 4.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvvNkE2vQVk). Good intro to thinking about images, audio, etc. as natural signals. Experiment in neural networks at the end also reinforced importance of locality to convolutions extremely well.
- First pass through the [[Bengio '94]](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/ieeetrnn94.pdf) paper on vanishing gradient problem in RNNs (day 1/3)
	- proof seems to be based on concept of size of open ball in some space becoming bigger with every time step
	- didn't quite grok usefulness of defining "basins" and the psuedo-basins 
	- re-read tomorrow: focus on understanding "latching" and some of the non-gradient descent methods attempt to overcome vanishing/exploding gradient
	- In one of the NYU lectures, Yann mentioned the fundamental premise of this paper was disproven. Need to figure out why this is.

Goals for the rest of the 3 days in the month:

- compile list of papers to read in resource list & order chronologically
- get google colab set up with github
- finish [4.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvvNkE2vQVk) and [4.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KSGNomPJTE) practicum on RNNs and CNNs from the NYU course
