I'm just your average software engineer trying to self-study deep learning. I graduated from Dartmouth College with a bachelor's in computer science in 2019, and have been working at Meta (Facebook) as a software engineer for over 2 years now. You can find several papers describing some of the work I've been doing at Meta [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.09974.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10450.pdf).

If you want to connect, my information should be in the footer.
