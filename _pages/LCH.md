title: LeetCode Hell

---

I'm helping a friend prep for interviews, and also as a byproduct I'm coming up with some algorithmic questions that (probably) aren't on leetcode. Some of these will be leetcode hell, a.k.a. a level harder than LC hard. I'll be posting our questions in session format (i.e. multiple questions related to each other, generally in increasing difficulty, as opposed to individual questions.

<details><summary>Party go-ers</summary>

<details><summary>Level 1</summary>
Suppose you are the director of an exclusive private club and you are throwing a benefit party. Your intern sends out an invitation to a selective group of individuals, who each RVSP to the party. In addition to whether the guests can make it or not, each guest also provides a list of people that they absolutely cannot stand seeing. Given the responses from every invitee and a possible guest list that your intern wants to invite, determine if the party consisting of the guest list you provide will simultaneously have a guest and another guest who they cannot stand seeing.

Suppose you are the director of an exclusive private club and you are throwing a benefit party. Your intern sends out an invitation to a selective group of individuals, who each RVSP to the party. In the RVSP, each guest provides a list of people that they absolutely cannot stand seeing, as well as a donation amount they would pay if attending the party. Given these invitation responses, determine a guest list for your party that maximizes donations for your charity, while having that no guest will see anyone they can't stand to.

<details><summary>Level 3</summary>

Suppose you are the director of an exclusive private club and you are throwing a benefit party. Your intern sends out an invitation to a selective group of individuals, who each RVSP to the party. On the invitation, each guest puts how much they would donate to attend your party. Your intern also does some research, and figures out that for some groups of invitees, if they are all simultaneously present at the party, they are super likely to get "crunk" and cause property damages of some amount. Given the RVSP responses and the list of damages gathered by your intern, determine a guest list party that maximizes your donations earned for your charity, which is calculated as (sum of donations - property damages).
